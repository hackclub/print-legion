description: main frontend rules for the app - please take into mind when doing any UI code
globs: *.tsx
---
- we use nextjs, tailwindcss, shadcn/ui, typescript
- package manager: bun
- i always prefer sonner over toast. do not install or use toast or useToast.
- do not hallucinate or create shadcn primitives or components yourself, ask to run the comand to add the related component e.g `bunx --bun shadcn@latest add popover`
- do not overwrite my app's main layout.tsx, or any other un-related files to the task without explicit permission via asking - there is no need to modify external code when the app works just fine - focus on modifying the section you are working on.
